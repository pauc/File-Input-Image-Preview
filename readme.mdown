Upload Image Preview
----

This jQuery plug-in uses the File API to show you a preview of your chosen image prior to uploading files via form file input boxes.

You can apply it to a single file input, or to all file inputs in a form.

When the user selects a file to upload, if that file is an image, then a thumbnail preview will be shown. If the file is not an image, an error message will be displayed.

The script also checks for errors on form submit and warns the user accordingly.

The plug-in generates a lot of CSS for you, so some assumptions are made about how the thumbnail image should be displayed. However, basic options like colors, borders, and shadows are comfigurable.

####Usage

Basic Configuration:

    $('.image-upload').imgPreview();

Advanced configuration:

    // You may pass any or all of the below options
    $('.image-upload').imgPreview({
        thumbnail_size:60,
        thumbnail_bg_color:"#ddd",
        thumbnail_border:"5px solid #fff",
        thumbnail_shadow:"0 0 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)",
        label_text:"Select an Image File",
        warning_message:"Not an image file.",
        warning_text_color:"#f00"
    });
